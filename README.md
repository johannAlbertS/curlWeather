# curlWeather
Recently I had nothing to do with my free time and I remembered an article from the computer magazine c't about curl, where was descriped how to fetch a weatherforecast with curl. So I
wrote this little one-liner, to fetch a weatherforecast for a specific city. 
## Needed software
You need
1. obviously curl
2. a linux system running with a bash. (For other shells maybe change the shebang)
## Usuage
Type `./weather.sh city` into your shell and replace "city" with the place you need the weatherforecast from. An Ascii-art with the weatherforecast will be printed.
